# (Yet Another) Introduction to Category Theory

This repository contains the slides of the presentation I gave at [ShiftForward](https://www.shiftforward.eu) on June 2017 about some basic concepts of category theory.

You'll need [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) to show or export presentation to another format. With that tool installed, you can serve the presentation as a webpage using:

```bash
reveal-md -w slides.md --css style.css
```

To export a standalone version of the presentation in HTML, including the required resources, run:

```bash
reveal-md slides.md --css style.css --static $output_path
```
